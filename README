Ruby wrapper for Kosmonaut - the WebRocket client
=================================================

Kosmonaut.rb is a ruby extension for the WebRocket client.
The idea of the Kosmonaut is to keep it simple, straightforward
and easy to maintain, although to allow to build more
sophisticated libraries at top of it.

Installation
------------
You can install it easily from rubygems:

    $ gem install kosmonaut

Or using bundler, add this line to your gemfile:

    gem 'kosmonaut'

Usage
-----
Kosmonaut has two components: Client and Worker. Client is
used to manage a WebRocket's vhost and broadcast messages,
for example:

    c = Kosmonaut::Client.new("/vhost", "token...")
    c.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:8081")

    c.open_channel("world")
    c.broadcast("world", "hello", {:who => "Chris"})
    c.broadcast("world", "bye", {:see_you_when => "Soon!"})

    c.disconnect

Worker is used to listen for incoming messages and handle
it in user's desired way, example:

   class MyWorker < Kosmonaut::Worker
     def on_message(event, data)
       if event == "hello"
         puts "Hello #{data[:who]}"
       end
     end

     def on_error(errcode)
       puts "Error encountered (code #{errcode})"
     end

     def on_exception(err)
       puts "Ouch! something went wrong! Error: #{err.to_s}"
     end
   end

   w = MyWorker.new("/vhost", "token...")
   w.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:8081")
   w.listen
